I have crate this "resetPasswordToken" column before, but later I have removed it from db using this migration script
======================
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name remove-resetPasswordToken-from-user ========== this will just create the migration file, then we have to edit it accordingly.
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

You're getting this error because you're using ES Modules ("type": "module"), but sequelize-cli and its dependency umzug expect CommonJS when loading migration files. This is a common conflict.
